# LLM Agent PRD Loading Rule

## Trigger Patterns
The agent will check for these patterns at the start of any conversation:
- `prd recent` - Load the most recently updated PRD
- `prd {name}` - Load the specific PRD with the matching name

## File Structure
All PRD files must be located in the `/prd` directory:
- Individual PRD files: `/prd/{prd_name}.md`
- Status tracking file: `/prd/prd_status.md`

## Processing Logic

### When conversation starts with "prd recent":
1. Parse `/prd/prd_status.md` to identify the most recently modified PRD
2. Load the corresponding PRD file from `/prd/{most_recent_prd}.md`
3. Use the PRD content as context for the conversation

### When conversation starts with "prd {name}":
1. Check if `/prd/{name}.md` exists
2. If found, load the PRD file content as context
3. If not found, inform the user the specified PRD doesn't exist

## Status Tracking File Format

The `/prd/prd_status.md` file maintains a structured record of all PRDs:

```markdown

- ðŸŸ¡ **In Progress** - Work actively underway
- ðŸ”µ **Planning** - Requirements gathering stage
- ðŸ”´ **Needs Attention** - Blocked or requires review
- âšª **Not Started** - Tasks identified but work not begun

## Implementation Notes
- The agent should track progress against the todo items in each PRD section
- PRDs are structured with clear sections and checklists for implementation tracking
- Each section contains specific, actionable todo items with checkboxes
- When items are completed, the agent should update the status ([ ] â†’ [x])
- The status tracking file helps maintain awareness of all active PRDs
